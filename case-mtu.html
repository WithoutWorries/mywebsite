<h2>MTU Aero Engines</h2>
    <h3>Electronic module / FPGA safety analysis, reliability prediction and simulation</h3>
<p>Engine protection and monitoring is a vital safety feature in aviation, particularly for aircraft systems where human lives depend on reliable performance. A prime example is the Electronic Protection & Monitoring Unit (EPMU) installed on the TP4-D6 engines powering the Airbus A400M military transport aircraft. The EPMU continuously monitors critical engine parameters to detect and swiftly respond to anomalies, proactively shutting down the engine to prevent hazardous situations or catastrophic failures.

To ensure optimal operational safety and reliability, extensive analysis and testing were carried out. The project rigorously adhered to industry-standard guidelines including SAE ARP 4761 (Guidelines and Methods for Conducting the Safety Assessment Process on Civil Airborne Systems and Equipment) and SAE ARP 5580 (Recommended Failure Modes and Effects Analysis Practices for Non-Automobile Applications). For deterministic reliability prediction of electronic components, the project utilized Military Handbook MIL-HDBK-217, while mechanical reliability predictions were guided by the Naval Surface Warfare Centre's 'Handbook of Reliability Prediction Procedures for Mechanical Equipment'.

Additionally, the project addressed the critical safety concern of cosmic radiation effects on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) at high altitudes, specifically Single Event Effects (SEEs) and Single Event Upsets (SEUs). These events, while not reliability issues per se, represent significant safety risks capable of inadvertently triggering critical functions. Therefore, comprehensive risk assessments were conducted using methodologies outlined in IEC TS 62396 ('Process Management for Avionics: Atmospheric Radiation Effects').

By integrating these assessments with Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), a detailed Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) was performed to quantify and mitigate the likelihood of hazardous engine shutdowns. This meticulous approach ensures maximum safety, reliability, and operational effectiveness of the Airbus A400M aircraft engines.
