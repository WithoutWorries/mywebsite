## Key Features Implemented

### Dashboard
- Real-time stats: open opportunities, weighted pipeline value, overdue tasks, follow-ups due

- Search and filter functionality
- Industry and company type categorization
- Regulatory environment tracking
- Contact and opportunity counts

- Comprehensive contact information
- Relationship types: Cold, Warm, Referral, Past Client, Current Client, Partner
- Influence levels: Decision Maker, Influencer, Technical Evaluator, Procurement, Unknown
- Last contact and next follow-up tracking with overdue highlighting

### Opportunities
- Full opportunity lifecycle tracking
- Multiple services: Reliability Engineering, RAMS, ILS, FMEA, FMECA, FHA, Safety Analysis, etc.
- Regulatory framework support: EASA, FAA, FDA, EU MDR, IEC standards, DEF STAN, etc.
- Weighted pipeline calculations (value × probability)
- Activity timeline for each opportunity

### Tasks
- Intelligent task grouping: Overdue, Due Today, This Week, Later, Completed
- Priority levels: Low, Medium, High, Urgent
- Quick mark-complete functionality
- Due date tracking with relative date formatting

### Activities
- Activity type tracking: Email, Call, Meeting, LinkedIn, Proposals, Notes, etc.

## Database Schema

The Prisma schema includes:

- **User**: Single user per instance (MVP hardcoded user_1)
- **Company**: Client companies with industry and regulatory info
- **Contact**: Professional contacts with relationship and influence tracking
- **Opportunity**: Sales opportunities with full details, services, and regulatory drivers
- **Activity**: Interaction logging (calls, emails, meetings, etc.)
- **Task**: Action items with priority and status
- **Note**: General notes attached to entities
- **Tag**: User-defined tags for companies, contacts, and opportunities

## Design System

- **Color Palette**: Slate gray base with indigo accents
- **Sidebar**: Slate-800 (dark) with white text navigation
- **Main Content**: White background with subtle shadows
- **Badges**: Color-coded by type (stage, relationship, priority, etc.)
- **Typography**: Clean sans-serif with semantic hierarchy

## API Routes

All routes use hardcoded `userId: "user_1"` for MVP:

- `GET/POST /api/companies` - List and create companies
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/companies/[id]` - Company detail operations
- `GET/POST /api/contacts` - List and create contacts
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/contacts/[id]` - Contact detail operations
- `GET/POST /api/opportunities` - List and create opportunities
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/opportunities/[id]` - Opportunity detail operations
- `GET/POST /api/tasks` - List and create tasks
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/tasks/[id]` - Task detail operations
- `GET/POST /api/activities` - List and create activities
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/activities/[id]` - Activity detail operations
- `GET /api/dashboard` - Dashboard stats and aggregations

## Notes

- This is an MVP implementation with hardcoded authentication (user_1)
- All data is stored in PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- The application is optimized for desktop and tablet use
- No external authentication provider is configured (email/password login with any password)
- Database timestamps use UTC (createdAt, updatedAt fields)

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication and multi-user support
- Real-time notifications
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Custom fields and workflows
- API documentation and third-party integrations
- Mobile app support
- Email notification triggers
- Automated activity logging from email/calendar

## Development Tips

1. Use `npm run db:studio` to inspect and modify database records visually
2. Check the Prisma schema in `prisma/schema.prisma` for data relationships
3. All components use TypeScript for type safety
4. CSS is purely Tailwind - no custom CSS files needed
5. API routes follow REST conventions and return JSON
